Application Flow:
The user starts the cli tool using the necessary commands and passing 2 variables [rounds, range]
|__ The first for the number of rounds and the latter for the range to guess from
    |__ Then a random number is generated
        |__ Then the user is asked to input his guess
            |__ Then we check if the users guess matches the number generated
                |__ If yes then it is counted as a win with details displayed in the terminal
                    |__ Else it is counted as a loss and the same thing is done as with the inverse
                        |__ At the end of the specified rounds, the result is shown to the user.


[First Iteration]

Procedural implementation flow:
1. create CliParams struct: to house the variables passed and use it throughout the program
2. create the build method to build CLI params struct with arguments
3. unit Testing
